    "content": "Mr Abbott was employed by a company that offered its executives options to buy a number of its unissued shares at the current market price. The options were not transferable, and would last for 10 years, as long as the purchaser remained in the company’s service. The price of the option was £1 per 100 shares. Mr Abbott bought an option on 2,000 shares in October 1954, paying £20. By March 1956 the market price of the shares had risen, and he exercised his option on 250 shares, which were worth £166 more than he paid for them.\nThe Revenue contended that, on exercising his option, Abbott had received an emolument from his employment. The shares were worth £166 more than he paid for them. This was a ‘perquisite or profit whatsoever’ and should be included in his Schedule E assessment for 1955/56.",

    "content": "This case went all the way to the House of Lords, and even then the Lords were not unanimous in their decision. The majority judgement went against the Revenue, because an option can be turned into money. Even though (in this particular case) the option itself could not be transferred, the holder could make an agreement with a third party to exercise the option and transfer the shares to that third party. Because it is money’s worth, the value of the option is an emolument of the year in which it is granted. The Revenue conceded that, if the option itself was an emolument when it was granted, there was no emolument when the option was exercised.\nBecause this would mean that the main part of the value passed to the employee would escape taxation, specific rules are contained in Part 7 of ITEPA, and earlier legislation, to override this tax case in most circumstances, particularly in cases involving options over securities other than shares.",

But specific legislation previously at ICTA88/S135 and, since 2003, in Chapter 5 Part 7 of ITEPA over rides the general rule in most cases.\nThe provisions of Chapter 5 mean that there is usually no charge to Income Tax when an option is granted, and liability arises when it is exercised.\nITEPA03/S475 states that there is no liability to Income Tax on grant. The only occasion of charge on grant of an option is where the option was granted at a discount under an approved CSOP (ITEPA03/S475 (2)), or where options are granted to non-resident employees.",

See ERSM162000.\nLong options - pre-16 April 2003\nWhere an option was granted prior to 16 April 2003, a charge to income tax arose on the grant of an option if it lasted for 10 years or more. For one granted before 6 April 1998 a charge arose on the grant of an option if it lasted for 7 years or more. These were sometimes called “long options” - see ERSM110200.",

As for rights issues, there will rarely be a gain because the issue of bonus or replacement shares will reduce the value of the existing holding. For replacement shares this value will actually become nil. Relief for such a reduction in value is provided by ITEPA03/S421D (3).\nExample\nIf there is a single class of shares and a one-for-one bonus issue each share will halve in value. In other words, if the share price were originally £1, each share will now be worth 50p. The holder will have received an additional share worth 50p from which is deducted the 50p fall in value of the original share (£1 down to 50p), leaving a gain of nil.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page",
