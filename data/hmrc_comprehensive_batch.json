    "content": "The concept of tax advantaged share schemes originated in FA 1978 with the introduction of approved profit sharing schemes (APSS, since abolished). In FA 1980 the Savings Related Share Option Scheme was introduced. Sometimes known as Sharesave (or SAYE), it is an all-employee share option scheme that links regular savings with share options. Discretionary share option schemes were introduced by FA 1984. They are now referred to in the legislation as CSOP schemes (previously known as company share option plans or executive share option schemes) and, as the previous name implies, employees are selected to participate rather than the company being obliged to invite all employees to take part.",

The former replaced the APSS with the flexibility to provide different types of share award and, like SAYE, it is an all-employee scheme. EMI, unlike the other schemes does not have an approval process, and is intended to help small higher risk companies to recruit and retain skilled employees.",

These are referred to as employment-related securities.\nThe manual explains how the tax and NICs code works where different forms of securities are used, such as options over securities, securities carrying restrictions and securities capable of being converted into other securities. It also includes guidance on the special rules that apply to university spinout companies, and some guidance on the tax consequences when employment-related securities are disposed of. It includes links to related subjects such as the valuation of shares, relief for the costs of providing employees with shares and the operation of the transfer pricing rules when an employee share scheme is operated in a group of companies.",

The main provisions were in Finance Acts 1988 and 1998, subsequently consolidated into ICTA1988. In 2003, the Tax Law Rewrite programme rewrote these provisions as the Income Tax Earnings & Pensions Act 2003 (ITEPA). Shortly after this, the tax regime was significantly reformed in Schedule 22 of Finance Act 2003, to provide a fairer, more coherent and consistent regime and deal with further extensive avoidance. As a result, ITEPA was extensively amended to include the FA 2003 changes. Since then ITEPA has been amended in relation to employment-related securities by various subsequent Finance Acts.",

The University decides to set up a spin-out company to develop the research further. It subscribes for 20 shares in the new company at par (£20). The University then transfers the IP as it stands into the spin-out company, with a proviso that it reverts to the University if further development is not fruitful. A further 30 shares are allocated to Thomas and More for which they pay £30. Each share is now worth £1,000. The relief for each researcher is shown in this computation:",

He sets up a spin-out company himself, paying for an initial 50 x £1 shares at market value of £50. Sometime later, after deciding that the invention is not yet developed sufficiently to licence, the University transfers the existing IP, worth £7,000, to the spin-out and takes 20 x £1 shares.

This will be a RI within s457(1)(i);\nA Public Sector Research Establishment (PSRE) conducting research in order to meet government objectives that meets the criteria at s457(1)(b),\nA multinational pharmaceuticals group has several research subsidiaries. They often work in conjunction with university research departments. None of the subsidiaries will qualify as a RI because they are controlled by a person (including, as in this case, a company) which “carries on activities for profit”,\nA French university has potentially commercial research. It will be a RI. This may be relevant if, for example, a person involved in the research is from the UK on short-term secondment or the spin-out activity is part located in the UK for whatever reason.",

These companies are commonly referred to as spin-out or spin-off companies. In this guidance the term spin-out will be used to describe them.\nMost RIs have in place an IP-sharing policy that acknowledges the researcher’s contribution to the IP by sharing the benefit of it with the researcher through a share of royalties or, where the IP is developed through a spin-out into which IP has been transferred, shares in that company. Where shares are obtained the researchers normally waive their rights to any further part of the university’s share in the spin-out company, because their reward will, hopefully, come from an increase in the value of their shares in the spin-out.",

As such it has found it worthwhile to establish a subsidiary company, Darius Ltd, to help researchers set these up, facilitate funding, provide administrative assistance, etc. It owns the majority of the share capital. IP owned by the university is routinely transferred to Darius Ltd in order to facilitate the spin-out process.\nOutcome",

A breakthrough prompts the formation of a joint spin-out company, Oenophile Ltd., to develop the idea of turning vinegar back into wine. The research developed at each university will be transferred into Oenophile Ltd., and the head of each research team, Epicurus and Apicius respectively, will be shareholders and directors. Epicurus and Apicius will each get 10% of the initial shareholding, 10 x £1 shares, paying their nominal value of £10. Outside investors will inject funding once the chief researchers and IP transfer have been secured.\nOutcome\nEpicurus and Apicius are eligible for relief in respect of the IP from both Athena and Romulus universities.",

On one particular project some work has been done in each laboratory, with researchers Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, employed by the Hippocrates Trust and PLC respectively, working alone and together. Hippocrates Trust and PLC jointly own IP, but only Hippocrates Trust has a policy of IP sharing with its researchers.\nWhen research progresses sufficiently to set up a spin-out company, this is done by the Hippocrates Trust, which transfers its IP into it. 10 of the 100 x £1 ordinary shares are given to its chief researcher, Dr. Jekyll, as an incentive to further development. PLC then takes 50 of the shares as well. Mr. Hyde is remunerated via Medico’s annual bonus scheme.\nOutcome",

This means that the restrictions on the shares will be ignored for tax purposes and the shares’ unrestricted market value at acquisition (that is, ignoring the value attributable to IP and the effect of the restrictions) will be taxed. There will be no further Income Tax or NICs when the restrictions are lifted or the shares are sold.\nExample 21\nHomer is invited to join a spin-out, Odyssey Ltd, at set-up and satisfies the conditions for relief. He is offered 100 shares for £1 par value, which are forfeitable under certain circumstances for a period of 3 years. The value taking into account the IP transfer agreement is £10 per share, the additional value of £9 being put into Odyssey through the IP.\nOutcome",

The market value of each share at that date is £30, but by then the original IP transferred under the agreement will only be one element contributing to this. Other factors might be money from external funding or the value of further developments to the IP by the spin-out itself.\nThe deemed ITEPA03/S431(1) election means that the full market value of £1,000 is chargeable to tax at the date of acquisition. Full effect of Chapter 4A can be given to disregard the effect of the element relating to the IP transfer agreement and no tax will be due. There will be no further chargeable event when the forfeiture condition lifts. Homer’s position may be summarised as:",

    "content": "Form of joint election by researcher and employer\nAn agreement under ITEPA03/S454(2) can only be made with the consent of both employee and employer because the agreement may affect the tax and NICs liabilities of both parties. The agreement must be made in a form approved by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and must be made before, or within 14 days after, the acquisition of shares by the employee.\nThe employer will normally be the Research Institution unless the researcher is only employed by the spin-out company, when it will be the latter.\nOnce an agreement has been signed by both parties it is irrevocable. Each party should retain a copy and produce it to HMRC if requested.\nExample 22\nUlysses is invited to join the same spin-out, Odyssey Ltd, as Homer (see ERSM100540) after 150 days, when funding has also been received and further research been done within the spin-out. The shares are restricted with a forfeiture condition if Ulysses leaves.\nOutcome",

Alternatively Ulysses can opt out of the deemed election by making an agreement with his employer under ITEPA03/S454(2) so that he is only charged to tax on the restricted value of the shares at acquisition. If he does this, he will be charged to tax under Chapter 2 at a later date when the restrictions on the shares are lifted, or another chargeable event within ITEPA03/S427 occurs.",

In the latter case, the correct identification of the divide between the two will dictate when, and in what amount, income tax and NICs arise – drawing a distinction between capital investment and revenue reward.\nIntroduction\n2.1 This memorandum follows discussions between UNICO and the Inland Revenue with regard to the tax treatment of the Academics who acquire shares in spin-out companies, following the Finance Act 2003.\n2.2 This memorandum describes a shareholding structure which meets UNICO’s objectives to:",

There is an IP-sharing agreement between them and the University, which ensures they receive half of all income and gains from developing their research.

A further 30 shares are allocated to Thomas and More for which they pay £30 and waive their rights under the IP-sharing agreement.\nAt the time of acquisition the value of the shares might be greater than the par value because of the potential of the IP. On the other hand the spin-out may fail – it is dependent on whether the research ever develops sufficiently to have commercial application.\nCommon variants\nThere are various approaches to setting up the spin-out:",

This increase is not relieved by the provisions of Chapter 4A, which only apply to increases in value occasioned by the introduction of intellectual property (IP) into the spin-out company.\nHowever, where the funding takes place at the same time as the IP is put in and shares are issued to the Research Institution (RI) and researchers, HMRC will accept that it was put in after the shares were issued and that its value is not reflected in the shares at the time of issue.\nExample 17\nIP is transferred into a shell company set up by the person involved in research, or the researcher acquires shares for their nominal value in a company containing only IP, set up by the RI. Funding will not be fully committed until after both researcher and institution are signed up.\nOutcome",

It does not affect the position of the RI itself, except that there will be no employer’s NICs to pay on the transfer of the IP. Nor will it affect the RI’s position for Capital Gains Tax (CGT) or Corporation Tax (CT). The spin-out company, and researchers’ shares, remain within the scope of Part 7 of ITEPA in all other respects.\nIn particular, where shares in a spin-out are acquired by a researcher after other events (such as introduction of funding or business development) have increased the value of the company, there could still be a residual charge to Income Tax and NICs based on shares acquired at less than market value, even though the effect on value of the IP is being ignored\nThe relief covers only the transfer of IP from the RI. It does not cover the transfer ofany other item of value, such as income from research contracts.",

HMRC is likely to conclude in actual valuations that the price is the same under both tests. If a significant difference does arise in a particular case, HMRC would need to consider whether an attempt has been made to exploit that difference.",

If the spin-out is not a success the IP transfers back to the University, any funding left is likely to revert to the lender under the terms on which investment was made, and Diana’s convertible shares are worth no more than she paid for them. There will be no liability to IT or CGT. If the spin-out is a success, Diana can sell her shares without converting them or after conversion. In either case there will be an Income Tax and NICs liability. The Memorandum contains fully worked examples.",

Much of it was previously published as a stand-alone document “Guidance for Participants in Research Institution Spinout Companies”. This has now been withdrawn. References to the relevant legislation are made at various places in this guidance. If you are in doubt you should consult the wording of the statute.\nReferences to legislation throughout this guidance, unless otherwise indicated, are to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA) – they are shown in the format as for example ITEPA03/S451, which stands for section 451 of ITEPA 2003 as amended by FinanceAct 2005.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext page",

The University transferred its IP to the spin-out in April 2004 and, later on, funding is secured when the potential product has developed a little more. No more thought is given to the potential charge under Part 7 of ITEPA until publicity before the Pre-Budget Report in late 2004.

When the spin-out in Example 2 (ERSM100110) is set up, and before funding is introduced, they are each offered 2 shares for £2, together with an employment position to continue the research. The shares are worth £100 each\nOutcome\nSocrates accepts the shares but is returning to Greece and declines the employment opportunity. His shares will not be employment-related securities, as he was not employed by the University and will not be employed by the spin-out, and he will not need the Chapter 4A relief. Any gain, if the spin-out succeeds and he can sell for a profit, will only be liable to CGT if he is then within the scope of UK taxation.",

Where this is the case, the effect of the residence and domicile status of the employee on the charge is precisely the same as with cash earnings. (See the Employment Income Manual, EIM40002, EIM42201 and EIM42207)\nThe effect of residence and domicile status on the taxation of general earnings is governed by Chapters 4 and 5 of Part 2 of ITEPA.\nSpecific employment income\nUntil 5 April 2015 Part 7 of ITEPA had its own residence rules, at ITEPA03/S421E for securities and in ITEPA03/S474 for securities options. Whether or not UK tax was chargeable in relation to employment-related securities might depend upon where an employee resided at the time the securities or securities options were awarded. This was regardless of where the work to earn that award was carried out, and whether it related to UK or non-UK duties.",

Instead, from 6 April 2015, if an amount counts as employment income under Chapters 2 to 5 of Part 7 (‘securities income’) of an ‘internationally mobile employee’, new Chapter 5B of Part 2 of ITEPA 2003 determines the amount of the securities income which is taxable in the UK.\nBroadly, Chapter 5B is intended to establish the period to which securities income can be regarded as relating and to apply to that income an approach similar to that provided by Chapters 4 and 5 of Part 2 in relation to general earnings. (See EIM40000 onwards.)\nCommencement\nThe new rules of Chapter 5B, Part 2 of ITEPA 2003 apply to employment-related securities options and employment-related securities from 6 April 2015, regardless of when they have been acquired.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page",

There is a public offer to buy the shares, and 50% are allocated to members of the public who are entitled to a £1 ‘registrant discount’.

In addition, subscribing employees are entitled to a further £1 discount.\nThe employees receive a total of £2 discount on each share.

Guidance on this new test is in the Residence, Domicile and Remittance Basis Manual.\nThere are transitional arrangements regarding the ‘abolition’ of ordinary residence.

    "content": "The extension of the application of the aforementioned Chapters of Part 7 to employees who, when they acquire securities or options, are not ordinarily resident, demanded consideration of a means of recognising that some of the employment income that would be charged by Part 7 might relate to foreign duties. It was also felt appropriate that existing, informal recognition in this guidance of the remittance basis for Part 7 income from foreign duties for foreign employers by “non-domiciles” should be recognised in statute. As a result, from 6 April 2008, new Chapter 5A of Part 2 of ITEPA 2003 applies the remittance basis to such employment income.\nThe guidance in this section is mainly concerned with the rules affecting internationally mobile employees (IMEs) acquiring options or securities on or after 6 April 2008. The guidance at ERSM161300 relates to the effect of tax treaties on UK tax treatment of employees acquiring options or securities both before and after 6 April 2008.",

He exercises his option on 30 September 2008 and thereby acquires employment-related securities for less than their market value. As the securities were acquired pursuant to a securities option which was itself acquired before 6 April 2008, the old rules of Chapter 3C will apply and the guidance at ERSM70420 et seq should be followed.\nPeriod from 6 April 2008 to Royal Assent\nThe new rules on remittance basis for employment-related securities are retrospective back to 6 April 2008 from the date of Royal Assent: that means that between 6 April and Royal Assent the law as it currently stands applies in its full force. Following Royal Assent, the retrospective nature of the legislation means that the law has to be regarded as rewritten.",

It might therefore be the case that an employer faced PAYE and NICs obligations on the award of an option or securities which, following Royal Assent, were removed, as the awards were exempt from an income tax charge by virtue of the rules of Part 7. See ERSM161020 for guidance on the operation of PAYE on the period between 6 April 2008 and Royal Assent and the remainder of the 2008/09 tax year.",

Instead, the phantom scheme promises participants a cash sum calculated so as to equate to the increase in the value of notional tracker-shares between a starting date (to mirror the date when a real option would have been granted) and a date or period of time when they can claim the cash bonus (to mirror when a real option would have been exercised). The promise, like a real share award or option, is usually subject to performance conditions that have to be met. The employee obtains a cash employment reward by reference to the increase in the value of the business in the same way as if a real option had been exercised and real shares acquired.",

    "content": "There are many commercial reasons why an employer may use such a phantom scheme: for example the company’s owners may be happy to share the economic value of equity, but not equity itself. Or the employer is a division of another company, but can create a measurement of its equity value and wants employees to have a share in that even though there is no actual stock.\nSubject to the detailed documentation, a phantom option is not an option, nor does it fall within any other category of security in ITEPA03/S420 (1). There is therefore no charge on grant of the phantom option under the provisions of Part 7 ITEPA03, nor is there a money’s worth charge under ITEPA03/S62 at this time. There is no right to acquire securities so it is not a securities option either, and therefore Chapter 5 does not apply. The cash will be taxed under ITEPA03/S62 in the same way as any other cash bonus.\nPhantom options: employer chooses to award shares in certain circumstances",

    "content": "Legal contracts\nIn legal terms an option is a contractual legal entitlement given by one party (normally the employing company) to another, for consideration or under deed or seal. The offer of an option, or a resolution by the Board of the company that shares should be allotted, does not constitute a legally enforceable right to shares. But offer and acceptance alone are sufficient to create a contract in Scotland.\nHowever, as mentioned in ERSM110010, a right to acquire shares can be much wider than a contractual option, and can be created, for example, under the terms of an employment contract. Where a company declares a rights issue of shares this will give the holders of the original shares a “right” to acquire further shares, which can be within the wider definition of “option” in the legislation.\n'Legal options' and other securities options (up to 5 april 2016)",

Where the option is granted under foreign law, other factors may be relevant.\nThe case of Abbott v Philbin (see ERSM110100) concerned a contractual option. The option in that case could be turned into money at the date when it was granted, even though it could not be transferred: Mr. Abbott could have made an agreement with a third party to exercise the option and transfer the shares to that third party.",

Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) (see ERSM110010), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) (see ERSM20192 onwards) and similar arrangements conferring rights to acquire securities are securities options but often involve an agreement or promise that falls short of being a legal option. In such cases we would not regard the acquisition of the right as the receipt of money’s worth. Until changes introduced by FA2016 and having effect for all securities options from 6 April 2016 (including options acquired before that date), the value of the securities awarded under the plan which was not a legal option was likely to be chargeable as money’s worth at the time of the acquisition of the securities themselves.\nHMRC officers may obtain advice on options granted under the law of other countries from the Employee Shares and Securities Unit (ESSU) - see ERSM10040.",

    "content": "Mr Abbott was employed by a company that offered its executives options to buy a number of its unissued shares at the current market price. The options were not transferable, and would last for 10 years, as long as the purchaser remained in the company’s service. The price of the option was £1 per 100 shares. Mr Abbott bought an option on 2,000 shares in October 1954, paying £20. By March 1956 the market price of the shares had risen, and he exercised his option on 250 shares, which were worth £166 more than he paid for them.\nThe Revenue contended that, on exercising his option, Abbott had received an emolument from his employment. The shares were worth £166 more than he paid for them. This was a ‘perquisite or profit whatsoever’ and should be included in his Schedule E assessment for 1955/56.",

    "content": "This case went all the way to the House of Lords, and even then the Lords were not unanimous in their decision. The majority judgement went against the Revenue, because an option can be turned into money. Even though (in this particular case) the option itself could not be transferred, the holder could make an agreement with a third party to exercise the option and transfer the shares to that third party. Because it is money’s worth, the value of the option is an emolument of the year in which it is granted. The Revenue conceded that, if the option itself was an emolument when it was granted, there was no emolument when the option was exercised.\nBecause this would mean that the main part of the value passed to the employee would escape taxation, specific rules are contained in Part 7 of ITEPA, and earlier legislation, to override this tax case in most circumstances, particularly in cases involving options over securities other than shares.",

Sometimes the employee will pay something for the option. A securities option is defined in the legislation (ITEPA03/S420 (8)) as a right to acquire securities. Such a right can be granted over any type of security. The legislation therefore covers more than a “share option”, as the term is normally understood.\nA share option, as the term is normally understood, will normally set out: -\n\nthe number of shares the employee can buy,\nthe price (if any) the employee will pay for those shares,\nthe dates from which, and by which the employee must exercise the option\nany conditions affecting the rights to exercise.",

Some arrangements falling under the generic description of Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) involve the employee being given a right to receive shares at the end of a “vesting period”. At the end of the vesting period, the employee does not need to do anything to acquire her shares; she simply acquires them as is her right under the LTIP. (For further discussion of LTIPs, see ERSM20192)\nThe main rules dealing with options from 16 April 2003 are in Chapter 5 of Part 7 of ITEPA 2003.",

He can exercise the option at any date between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008. On 1 January 2005 the market value of the shares was £2.74. Simon watches the share price rise, and decides to wait until the final month of the option’s life before exercising his rights. In December 2008 the shares are worth £4.80.

However, where the purchaser of a company has the choice of paying the earn-out in cash or securities, then it may not be a securities option. (See ERSM110025.)\nEmployees in receipt of such securities options may continue to work for the business or cease their employment. Employees who continue to work for the business will have acquired a securities option from their prospective employer and ITEPA03/S471(3) deems this to be ‘by reason of employment’. Employees who cease to work at the time the business is sold may also be deemed to have acquired an employment-related securities option by virtue of ITEPA03/S471(4).",

There will then be no liability to Income Tax arising.\nThis guidance is only applicable to the computation of employment income under Chapter 5 Part 7 ITEPA 2003 and has no bearing on the rules for Capital Gains Tax.",

As for rights issues, there will rarely be a gain because the issue of bonus or replacement shares will reduce the value of the existing holding. For replacement shares this value will actually become nil. Relief for such a reduction in value is provided by ITEPA03/S421D (3).\nExample\nIf there is a single class of shares and a one-for-one bonus issue each share will halve in value. In other words, if the share price were originally £1, each share will now be worth 50p. The holder will have received an additional share worth 50p from which is deducted the 50p fall in value of the original share (£1 down to 50p), leaving a gain of nil.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page",

The following paragraphs explain how the rules in Part 7 of ITEPA will be applied to achieve this policy intention and provide some guidance in identifying the divide between remuneration and capital.\nBusiness sales",

The amount charged to tax is the difference between the market value of the shares at the time the shares were acquired and the amount paid for them. If anything was paid for the grant of the option this is added to the amount paid for the shares.\nICTA88/S135 brings a gain on the exercise of an option within Schedule E. It also applies to making money out of the option in any other way such as assigning it (selling it to someone else) or cancelling it in return for cash (releasing it).",

But specific legislation previously at ICTA88/S135 and, since 2003, in Chapter 5 Part 7 of ITEPA over rides the general rule in most cases.\nThe provisions of Chapter 5 mean that there is usually no charge to Income Tax when an option is granted, and liability arises when it is exercised.\nITEPA03/S475 states that there is no liability to Income Tax on grant. The only occasion of charge on grant of an option is where the option was granted at a discount under an approved CSOP (ITEPA03/S475 (2)), or where options are granted to non-resident employees.",

See ERSM162000.\nLong options - pre-16 April 2003\nWhere an option was granted prior to 16 April 2003, a charge to income tax arose on the grant of an option if it lasted for 10 years or more.

Business has a very wide meaning here and is not limited to simple trading transactions. Even if business carried on with other members of the group is done on arms length terms it still counts as group business. The meaning of ‘substantially the whole’ is deliberately not limited by a particular percentage, so that a reasonable decision can be taken on whether or not the condition is met, based on the ordinary meaning of the words in the individual case. However to pass this test we would expect at least 90 per cent of the business to be carried on outside the group.",

If the period of account is less than or more than a year a proportionately greater or smaller percentage is taken.",

The group is treated as a Small or Medium Enterprise (SME) for transfer pricing purposes. The market value rental would be £10,000 p.a.. It is accepted that this will affect the value of 40% of the shares by £4,000 each year.\nThe increase in value of the shares is caused by a favourable contract with the parent company on a non-arm’s length basis.

It applies up to 15 April 2003, but there are no transitional provisions for accumulated charges up to that date. Only if there is a chargeable event (at 7 year point or on sale) before 16 April 2003 will the old legislation apply. Thereafter Chapter 3B will tax artificial increases in the value of securities but only those arising on or after 16 April 2003.\nOnly directors and employees chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule E in respect of the employment that gives rise to the acquisition of shares in the dependent subsidiary are within the scope of the dependent subsidiary provisions. For the purpose of FA88/S79 the terms ‘director’ and ‘employee’ include persons who are about to become directors and employees. References to employees should be read as including directors.",

    "content": "Introduction\nChapter 3B in Part 7 of ITEPA counters avoidance. It treats value realised by artificial increases to the value of securities (things done other than for genuine commercial purposes, see ERSM60020) as employment income.\nCommencement\nChapter 3B applies with effect from 16 April 2003, although some of the provisions affecting restricted securities only came into force on 1 September 2003. It does not matter whether the securities were acquired before or after 16 April 2003, but those acquired before are treated as if acquired on 16 April 2003 (FA03/SCH22/Para6).\nThe charge\nThe charge applies where the market value of a security has been increased by more than10% in a relevant period. See examples at ERSM60030.\nThe charge imposed by ITEPA03/S446L (ERSM60100) is a free-standing one. There are also provisions under ITEPA03/S446N and ITEPA03/S446M inrelation to restricted securities which modify the charge under Chapter 2 (ERSM60120).\nHow this chapter works",

See ERSM60100.\nIf there is potential Chapter 3B liability\nHMRC officers should seek advice from the Employee Shares and Securities Unit (ESSU) – see ERSM10040.\nMultiple charges\nIf unusual structures or transactions which have their own tax consequences are used in an attempt to avoid tax it is highly likely that multiple charges to Income Tax and NICs will arise under Chapter 3B and elsewhere. Where multiple charges arise in an avoidance case, advice on how to pursue these should be obtained from ESSU – see ERSM10040.\nDependent subsidiary\nThere was a fore-runner to Chapter 3B in the dependent subsidiary legislation introduced in 1988 – see ERSM61000 et seq.",

Each employee will have their own class of shares so different dividends can be paid to each. The shares have no rights other than that the employer can award dividends at his discretion.\n\nEach dividend is acting as if it were a cash bonus specific to the employee. Each time the dividend is voted the value of the share will rise and each time the dividend is paid, the value will fall again. The accumulated rises for the year will be artificial increases in value of the shares caught by Chapter 3B - the legislation disregards the falls in value.\nIf there is a large number of employees the classes of shares may be designated A, B, C, etc. hence the generic description “alphabet soup”.\nExample 4: selective conversion",

For instance, if a parent company routes a large proportion of the profitable business of the group through a particular subsidiary, the shares of that subsidiary will increase in value as a result. But even if the re-routed business had its source in the parent company, the value of the shares of the parent company will not be adversely affected by this because it incorporates the value of its subsidiaries.\nIf, therefore, employees or directors are given shares in a subsidiary company, it is easy for the parent company to shift value into those shares to further reward those directors and employees.\nRemoval of certain companies from scope of charge",

    "content": "Removal of certain companies from scope of charge\nNonetheless some groups wish to give directors and employees shares in subsidiary companies for valid commercial reasons. This is often the case where the subsidiary inquestion operates independently of the group as a whole such that the performance of the shares in the parent company is too remote to act as a motivator. In certain circumstances the legislation therefore excepts shares in such companies from the growth-in-value charge, which taxes normal growth as well as value-shifts. It allows them instead to be subject to the post-acquisition charge, in the same way as shares in non-subsidiary companies.\nThe independent subsidiary company identified by the legislation is one where the opportunity for value shifting by the parent is minimal. The onus for deciding that a subsidiary company is not a dependent subsidiary is placed initially on the directors of the group parent and on the company’s auditors.",

This is because the post-acquisition charge applies to shares which were acquired in an independent company at any time when that company is an independent company.\nIn Example 1, however, the shares on acquisition were shares in a dependent subsidiary company, and such shares can never be subject to the post-acquisition charge. They remain subject to the growth-in-value charge for the 7 years from acquisition even if the company becomes an independent company within that period.\nExample 4 – transition from dependent subsidiary to Chapter 3B\nOn 1 January 1997 an employee acquires 500 shares in a company which is a dependent subsidiary company.

Please note that option 1 can also include grants or awards already made, as long as the NICs liability has not arisen before the joint election is entered into.An important point to note is that while a joint election can be used to cover future grants and awards, the legislation will only allow the transfer of employer’s NICs for those grants and awards that have actually been made during the periods specified in the election.For example, a joint election uses option 2 to cover securities options granted between 6 April 2015 and 5 April 2025.

But on 10 May 2018 HMRC serves the comapny with a notice withdrawing approval for the Joint Election, which means that any options granted from the 10 May 2018 onwards are no longer covered by the joint election.The important point is that, despite the withdrawal of approval part way through the election’s stated period of cover, the election remains effective for NICs liabilities arising on those options granted before approval was withdrawn. So, in this example, the options already granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018 still remain covered by the election and employer’s NICs can still be transferred as and when the option gains occur.

From 1 September 2004, the amount subject to NIC does not take into account any income tax relief available under:\n\nITEPA03/S481 (relief for secondary Class 1 contributions met by employee), or\nITEPA03/S482 (relief for special contribution met by employee).",

Securities are defined in the regulations as having the meaning given in ITEPA03/S420. Schedule 2 of the SSCR01 explains how earnings are calculated in certain cases. Paragraph (5)(1)(a) of Schedule 2 says that where payment is by way of the beneficial interest in any asset falling within Part III of Schedule 3, the amount of earnings is the best estimate which can reasonably be made of the amount of general earnings in respect of that asset.\nPart II of Schedule 3 of the Regulations provides for certain payments in kind to be disregarded from earnings. However, Part III of Schedule 3 makes it clear that a payment by way of a readily convertible asset, within the meaning of ITEPA03/S702, is not disregarded as a payment in kind.",

The most important exception is that shares acquired under a tax advantaged share or option scheme, or an Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) option, are not within the scope of PAYE and NICs when, as often happens, Income Tax charges arise on the exercise of options. It is important to remember however that the exception only applies where the shares are actually acquired in accordance with the tax advantaged scheme. The exception does not apply, when as sometimes happens shares are acquired outside the terms of the tax advantaged scheme.\nHowever, prior to 9 April 2003 PAYE and NICs were not exigible on CSOP options exercised early (before the end of the three year qualification period).\nAdvice on the circumstances in which such shares have been acquired can be obtained from the Employee Shares & Securities Unit (see ERSM10040).",

Companies could limit the liability to the gain attributable to the growth in the company share price up to the 7 November 2000. The 6 April was the date on which gains on the exercise, assignment, or release of unapproved share options became liable to NIC. The 19 May was the date on which the Government announced the legislation allowing employees to agree to bear the employer’s NIC.\nThe format of the notification was prescribed in the Social Security Contributions (Share Options) Regulations 2001 laid before Parliament on 11 May 2001.

    "content": "Where settlement was made a company was able to remove the need to make further provisions against profits for the NIC liability and can remove the provision from their accounts once the NICs is settled. The company also saved NIC in relation to any further upward movement of the share price.\nThe legislation also assisted companies where no NIC liability would arise on share options calculated by using the share price at 7 November 2000. This could happen where the shares were underwater, or the shares (and the option itself) were not readily convertible assets on 7 November 2000. In such circumstances no notification by the company concerned was required because a notification was deemed to have been made where the liability would be nil.\nFrequently asked questions originally published on our web site can be found at ERSM170910.",

That notification had to be made within the 92 day period commencing on the 11 May 2001 which was the date when the Bill received Royal Assent.

The deemed gain was the difference between what might reasonably be expected to have been obtained if the shares had been sold in the open market on 7 November 2000 and the total exercise price of that option together with the amount of any consideration given for the grant of that option. See Q19 for guidance on share price.\nTop of page\nQ4. What was the amount due from the employee?\nThe special contribution due on the deemed gain was an employer only charge. An employee was not liable for employee’s NIC on either the deemed gain or the actual gain where settlement was made under this Act.\nQ5.What is the format of the notification?\nThe format of the notification is prescribed in the Social Security Contributions (Share Options) Regulations 2001, which were laid in Parliament on the 11 May 2001.",

Any further share option gain will not be subject to NIC on either the employer or the employee. However, there are special rules to cover rollovers, where a further charge may apply. Similarly, if the share price subsequently falls or the options are not exercised there will be no refund.\nTop of page\nQ8.

This flexibility was introduced so that the employer could consider the exercise price for various grants, and make a judgement as to whether various employees will actually exercise.\nTop of page",

Therefore, these employers would be deemed to have notified a nil liability and will not usually have to pay Class 1 on the actual share option gain. However, under clause 2(3) of the Bill, should the option be cash cancelled in the future for an amount which exceeds the gain which otherwise would have arisen on the option immediately prior to its cancellation then Class 1 NIC will be due on the excess (rather than on the full gain as under the current Class 1 rules).",

It includes both taxable earnings (see EIM00511) and any taxable specific income (see EIM00512).\nThe following steps apply for employment-related securities where the employment income is taxable earnings.  An amount will be taxable specific income if there is a charge to tax under any of the provisions within Part 7 ITEPA (see ERSM170100).\nStep 2 - Is the security a readily convertible asset (RCA) in accordance with ITEPA03/S702(1) – (5)? For example, the securities are quoted or subject to current or future trading arrangement. If YES, then PAYE is due. If NO, then go to step 3.",

    "content": "Option roll-overs: transitional provisions on introduction of PAYE & NICs\nPrior to 6 April 1999, a NICs liability arose on the grant of an option rather than on the actual gain from the exercise of an option. There are therefore some transitional provisions relating to options granted before 6 April 1999 which are rolled over after that date.\nEqually PAYE on share option exercise only arises in respect of options granted after 26November 1996. The following is a summary of the transitional provisions.\nA share option is a right to acquire shares. Both the PAYE regulations and the NICs regulations apply on the exercise of options, but only if the rights were acquired on or after the relevant dates. A full Chronology of the NICs legislation is set out in ERSM170710.",

NICs applies to the gain on exercise of share options where the rights were acquired on or after 6 April 1999.

Events during the life of the option may mean that the option is given up in exchange for another option. When this happens the replacement option may be equivalent to the old option but, although it is equivalent, the grant of the replacement option is the acquisition of a new right to acquire shares.\nExample",

Although it was designed to tax manipulated benefits, it can also apply in circumstances where employee shareholders are treated particularly favourably for commercial reasons.\nThe charge to tax is made for the year of assessment in which the benefit is received and is on an amount equal to the value of the benefit - FA88/S80 (4).\n \nExample\nOn 1 January 2000 an employee acquires 500 shares in a company at a cost (which is their market value) of £2 per share.",

No other shareholder receives any shares.\nThere is a charge under Schedule E on the market value of £150 (50 x £3).\n \nMeaning of `benefit`\nThe section does not define the meaning of the word ‘benefit’. A benefit might take the form of bonus or rights issue shares, of cash, of vouchers or tokens exchangeable for goods or services, or of any form of shareholder ‘perk’.\nIt is important to note that most benefits received by employee shareholders would not be special benefits’ within FA88/S80. This is because either they are chargeable to Income Tax under some other provision, or the benefit is specifically exempted from being a special benefit.\nThe exemption conditions are set out in ERSM91020.",

Where investors are carrying out their normal investment transaction, this charge will not affect them.” (Standing Committee B, Clause 12, 21 June 2005)",

Benefits include a whole range of things. For example, the provision of travel, accommodation or other vouchers not caught by other benefits legislation because their receipt stems from the possession of employment-related securities, such as free ferry trips given to all its employee shareholders by a ferry company. However, a similar benefit provided for both employee and non-employee shareholders might be exempt through ITEPA03/S449 - see ERSM90210.\nIntrinsic and extrinsic benefits",

But where the value of an employee’s share is increased by something done that rewards the employee, the benefit would be intrinsic, e.g. by amending articles of association.\nBonus shares\nA common benefit would be the provision of bonus shares. Prior to 16 April 2003 rights issues might also be within Chapter 4, but now they are more likely to be caught by Chapter 5 - see ERSM111000. Because Chapter 4 only applies to employees resident and ordinarily resident at time of acquisition (see ERSM90030), other employees may only be chargeable on bonus shares under Chapter 3C (see ERSM70010).\nThe amount of the benefit would be the market value of the bonus shares less any reduction in value of the original holding caused by the issue of the bonus shares.\nAmending articles of association",

It allows all shareholders to purchase goods produced by the company at 20% discount. No benefit is charged under Chapter 4 because a similar benefit is received by the owners of all the company’s shares of that class and, immediately before receipt of that benefit, the company is employee-controlled by virtue of holdings of shares of that class (ITEPA03/S449 (2)). Such benefits may, of course, be taxed under the general benefits code.\nNot all benefits taken up\nAlthough the legislation requires a similar benefit to be received by all owners of the class of share, HMRC will accept that a right to a similar benefit given to all shareholders of that class of share, whether taken up or not, will satisfy this test– provided (as from 7 May 2004) that it is not part of a scheme for avoiding Income Tax or NIC.",

In the meantime, until the retrospective regulations are in force, any NICs liability will only arise in respect of payments made on or after 20 July 2005 (date of Royal Assent of the Finance (No.2) Act 2005).\nAny PAYE liability in respect of benefits held to be received between 2 December 2004 and 20 July 2005 and chargeable under s.447 ITEPA by virtue of the amendment introduced by F(No.2)A 2005 will not arise until PAYE regulations are introduced simultaneously with the NICs regulations.",

Normal dividends are unlikely to be charged under Chapter 4 because they are chargeable to Income Tax under Chapter 3 (old Schedule F) and Chapter 4 (old Case V of Schedule D) Part 4 ITTOIA 2005. This was made clear in the ministerial statement set out below.\nMinisterial statement 21 June 2005\nThe Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) made the following statement in the Standing Committee on Finance (No. 3) Bill 2005 on 21 June 2005 to clarify the scope of an amendment:\n“These arrangements are devised to deal with the minority of cases where there are complex, contrived arrangements to avoid paying Income Tax and National Insurance on employment rewards. The Government have made clear their intention to close that activity down permanently.",
