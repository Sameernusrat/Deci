Other employees are dealt with through the provisions of Chapter 3C (securities acquired for less than market value) - previously ICTA88/S162.\nThe rules apply to shares up to 31 August 2003 and to other securities up to 15 April 2003.\nWhen an employee exercises an option he acquires the shares to which the option gave a right. The amount charged to tax is the difference between the market value of the shares at the time the shares were acquired and the amount paid for them. If anything was paid for the grant of the option this is added to the amount paid for the shares.\nICTA88/S135 brings a gain on the exercise of an option within Schedule E. It also applies to making money out of the option in any other way such as assigning it (selling it to someone else) or cancelling it in return for cash (releasing it).",

Sometimes the employee will pay something for the option. A securities option is defined in the legislation (ITEPA03/S420 (8)) as a right to acquire securities. Such a right can be granted over any type of security. The legislation therefore covers more than a “share option”, as the term is normally understood.\nA share option, as the term is normally understood, will normally set out: -\n\nthe number of shares the employee can buy,\nthe price (if any) the employee will pay for those shares,\nthe dates from which, and by which the employee must exercise the option\nany conditions affecting the rights to exercise.",

Some arrangements falling under the generic description of Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) involve the employee being given a right to receive shares at the end of a “vesting period”. At the end of the vesting period, the employee does not need to do anything to acquire her shares; she simply acquires them as is her right under the LTIP.

    "content": "Example\nOn 1 January 2005, Simon is granted an option over 5,000 shares in the company he works for, United Dyers plc, at £3 per share. He can exercise the option at any date between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008. On 1 January 2005 the market value of the shares was £2.74. Simon watches the share price rise, and decides to wait until the final month of the option’s life before exercising his rights. In December 2008 the shares are worth £4.80. Simon buys 5,000 shares for £15,000 and immediately sells them for £24,000, making a £9,000 gain. That gain is chargeable to Income Tax under Chapter 5 Part 7 ITEPA 2003 - see ERSM110510. National Insurance Contributions will also apply.\nOptions used in avoidance\nSee ERSM20200 on securities options used in avoidance.",

As for rights issues, there will rarely be a gain because the issue of bonus or replacement shares will reduce the value of the existing holding. For replacement shares this value will actually become nil. Relief for such a reduction in value is provided by ITEPA03/S421D (3).\nExample\nIf there is a single class of shares and a one-for-one bonus issue each share will halve in value. In other words, if the share price were originally £1, each share will now be worth 50p. The holder will have received an additional share worth 50p from which is deducted the 50p fall in value of the original share (£1 down to 50p), leaving a gain of nil.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page",

But specific legislation previously at ICTA88/S135 and, since 2003, in Chapter 5 Part 7 of ITEPA over rides the general rule in most cases.\nThe provisions of Chapter 5 mean that there is usually no charge to Income Tax when an option is granted, and liability arises when it is exercised.\nITEPA03/S475 states that there is no liability to Income Tax on grant. The only occasion of charge on grant of an option is where the option was granted at a discount under an approved CSOP (ITEPA03/S475 (2)), or where options are granted to non-resident employees.",

See ERSM162000.\nLong options - pre-16 April 2003\nWhere an option was granted prior to 16 April 2003, a charge to income tax arose on the grant of an option if it lasted for 10 years or more. For one granted before 6 April 1998 a charge arose on the grant of an option if it lasted for 7 years or more. These were sometimes called “long options” - see ERSM110200.",

The following paragraphs explain how the rules in Part 7 of ITEPA will be applied to achieve this policy intention and provide some guidance in identifying the divide between remuneration and capital.\nBusiness sales",

    "content": "Legal contracts\nIn legal terms an option is a contractual legal entitlement given by one party (normally the employing company) to another, for consideration or under deed or seal. The offer of an option, or a resolution by the Board of the company that shares should be allotted, does not constitute a legally enforceable right to shares. But offer and acceptance alone are sufficient to create a contract in Scotland.\nHowever, as mentioned in ERSM110010, a right to acquire shares can be much wider than a contractual option, and can be created, for example, under the terms of an employment contract. Where a company declares a rights issue of shares this will give the holders of the original shares a “right” to acquire further shares, which can be within the wider definition of “option” in the legislation.\n'Legal options' and other securities options (up to 5 april 2016)",

Where the option is granted under foreign law, other factors may be relevant.\nThe case of Abbott v Philbin (see ERSM110100) concerned a contractual option. The option in that case could be turned into money at the date when it was granted, even though it could not be transferred: Mr. Abbott could have made an agreement with a third party to exercise the option and transfer the shares to that third party.",

Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) (see ERSM110010), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) (see ERSM20192 onwards) and similar arrangements conferring rights to acquire securities are securities options but often involve an agreement or promise that falls short of being a legal option. In such cases we would not regard the acquisition of the right as the receipt of money’s worth. Until changes introduced by FA2016 and having effect for all securities options from 6 April 2016 (including options acquired before that date), the value of the securities awarded under the plan which was not a legal option was likely to be chargeable as money’s worth at the time of the acquisition of the securities themselves.\nHMRC officers may obtain advice on options granted under the law of other countries from the Employee Shares and Securities Unit (ESSU) - see ERSM10040.",

(See ERSM110025.)\nEmployees in receipt of such securities options may continue to work for the business or cease their employment. Employees who continue to work for the business will have acquired a securities option from their prospective employer and ITEPA03/S471(3) deems this to be ‘by reason of employment’. Employees who cease to work at the time the business is sold may also be deemed to have acquired an employment-related securities option by virtue of ITEPA03/S471(4).",

There will then be no liability to Income Tax arising.\nThis guidance is only applicable to the computation of employment income under Chapter 5 Part 7 ITEPA 2003 and has no bearing on the rules for Capital Gains Tax.",

Instead, the phantom scheme promises participants a cash sum calculated so as to equate to the increase in the value of notional tracker-shares between a starting date (to mirror the date when a real option would have been granted) and a date or period of time when they can claim the cash bonus (to mirror when a real option would have been exercised). The promise, like a real share award or option, is usually subject to performance conditions that have to be met. The employee obtains a cash employment reward by reference to the increase in the value of the business in the same way as if a real option had been exercised and real shares acquired.",

Or the employer is a division of another company, but can create a measurement of its equity value and wants employees to have a share in that even though there is no actual stock.\nSubject to the detailed documentation, a phantom option is not an option, nor does it fall within any other category of security in ITEPA03/S420 (1). There is therefore no charge on grant of the phantom option under the provisions of Part 7 ITEPA03, nor is there a money’s worth charge under ITEPA03/S62 at this time. There is no right to acquire securities so it is not a securities option either, and therefore Chapter 5 does not apply. The cash will be taxed under ITEPA03/S62 in the same way as any other cash bonus.\nPhantom options: employer chooses to award shares in certain circumstances",

For years up to 1997/98 the time span for a long option was seven years. It was increased to 10 years with effect from 6 April 1998.\nThe measure of the charge under ICTA88/S19 (1) was the value of the option on the date it is granted, less anything paid for the option. The value of an option was fixed by ICTA88/S135 (5)(b) as not less than the market value of the shares subject to the option on the date of grant less the price to be paid for the shares on exercise.\nDefinition of “shares”\nShares included stock (interest of any member in a company) and other securities as defined in ICTA88/S254 (1), but did not include Government gilts.\nCharge on not ordinarily resident employees (non-Case 1 Schedule E)",

    "content": "If an employee exercises an option to acquire quoted shares and sells the shares acquired through the stock exchange on the same day that the option is exercised, the sale price of the shares may be accepted as the market value for the purposes of assessing the gain made on exercise. Normally with a cashless exercise the exercise and sale will take place on the same day. There may be circumstances where, with an exercise late on Day One and large number of securities placed with the broker, that the sales extend into Day Two. HMRC will accept the cashless exercise treatment whereby the actual sale price is used in these circumstances also. (See ERSM220060)\nIn other cases (for example, where sales of shares extend beyond the second day, or if the shares are unquoted shares) market value at the date of exercise should be established. Guidance on obtaining valuations of shares for this purpose is given at ERSM220000.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page",

    "content": "Mr Abbott was employed by a company that offered its executives options to buy a number of its unissued shares at the current market price. The options were not transferable, and would last for 10 years, as long as the purchaser remained in the company’s service. The price of the option was £1 per 100 shares. Mr Abbott bought an option on 2,000 shares in October 1954, paying £20. By March 1956 the market price of the shares had risen, and he exercised his option on 250 shares, which were worth £166 more than he paid for them.\nThe Revenue contended that, on exercising his option, Abbott had received an emolument from his employment. The shares were worth £166 more than he paid for them. This was a ‘perquisite or profit whatsoever’ and should be included in his Schedule E assessment for 1955/56.",

The increase in value of the shares did not arise from the employment, but from the overall prosperity of the company.",

    "content": "This case went all the way to the House of Lords, and even then the Lords were not unanimous in their decision. The majority judgement went against the Revenue, because an option can be turned into money. Even though (in this particular case) the option itself could not be transferred, the holder could make an agreement with a third party to exercise the option and transfer the shares to that third party. Because it is money’s worth, the value of the option is an emolument of the year in which it is granted. The Revenue conceded that, if the option itself was an emolument when it was granted, there was no emolument when the option was exercised.\nBecause this would mean that the main part of the value passed to the employee would escape taxation, specific rules are contained in Part 7 of ITEPA, and earlier legislation, to override this tax case in most circumstances, particularly in cases involving options over securities other than shares.",

Such a contract in the hands of Bank B is clearly worth £25,000. In practice, the contract would be settled in cash, without gilts being involved, having been passed through the hands of the employee and others in a series of transactions.\nIf you see such instruments being used, please pass the case to the Technical Advisers, ESSU - see ERSM10040.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this page useful?\n\n\n\n              Maybe\n \n\n\n              Yes this page is useful\n \n\n\n              No this page is not useful\n \n\n\n\n\n      Thank you for your feedback\n    \n\n\n        Report a problem with this page",

    "content": "A Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is a generic name for a plan that aims to provide incentives to employees over the long-term, usually a year or more, via reward linked to shares or securities. It could involve the award of securities, the grant of securities options or be a cash bonus scheme that tracks movements in securities. The particular form that an LTIP takes will determine its taxation treatment.\nRestricted stock units (RSU)\nLTIPs frequently use what are known as restricted stock units, or restricted share units (RSUs). An RSU award is normally an agreement to issue stock or shares at the time the award vests. An award will vest when all the conditions laid down to be satisfied before the stock or shares may be issued have been met, e.g. the required duration of time, period of employment, or performance criteria. Again, the particular facts of any award, rather than its label, will determine the correct tax treatment.",

On a strict reading of the legislation, cessation of employment in a split year would mean that the split year treatment had no effect. However, it was not the intention of the legislative change that this should be the outcome.\nESC A11 is applied in respect of Part 7 to treat the split parts of years as separate tax years, so that ITEPA03/S421E (and ITEPA03/S474) could apply to them without any difficulty. If employment ceased in the UK part of the split year, then Chapters 2 to 4 (and Chapter 5) applied. If it ceased in the overseas part of the split year, then Chapters 2 to 4 (and Chapter 5) did not apply.",

However, in most reorganisations of share capital or in a take-over what has been given up matches in value what has been acquired.",

The earnings are treated as received at the time when the benefit is provided.\nFor Part 7 of ITEPA03 there is a specific statutory rule determining the date of acquisition in ITEPA03/S421B (2) (see ERSM20420). This does not apply to the money’s worth charge, although in practice there is unlikely to be any difference.\nEntitlement itself may be conditional and the date of acquisition can then be dependent on the conditions being fulfilled. It is usually possible to determine the date of entitlement by a review of the rules of the scheme under which the shares are acquired.",

It includes the right, obtained for payment or under seal, to buy or sell specified assets at a specified price within a specified time. Generally, an option is a right which is contractually enforceable on its own terms. Many options we see are granted under overseas plans. In such cases what makes an option contractually enforceable on its own terms is determined under the law of the relevant overseas jurisdiction. If you are in doubt whether what is styled an option is contractually enforceable on its own terms, contact ESSU (ERSM10040).\n‘Securities option’ has a specific statutory meaning per ITEPA03/S420 (8) - “the right to acquire securities”.

Call options over securities (providing they are not used in avoidance on or after 2 December 2004) are excluded from being “securities” by ITEPA03/S420 (5)(e) - see ERSM20200.\nTop of page\nPut options\nIn some circumstances individuals are given the right to sell shares that they currently own. Such rights are often referred to as ‘put’ options. A put option is not a ‘securities option’ within the meaning of ITEPA03/S420 (8), since it does not give the holder the right to acquire securities, but to sell them. Put options do not generally give rise to income tax charges under Part 7, either because they have no intrinsic value or they form part of the rights attaching to the shares themselves",

    "content": "The principles that apply to replacement or additional securities also apply to rights issues. A rights issue in respect of employment-related securities will be an employment-related securities option, potentially charged under Chapter 5 (see ERSM110000). However a gain will rarely arise because the rights issue will reduce the value of the existing holding.\nIn practice, problems are unlikely to arise where employees hold quoted shares. Where the shares are unquoted, an examination of the circumstances should quickly determine whether value has been transferred from one group of shareholders to the employees. We are unlikely to be interested in whether, for example, a couple of minority shareholders have failed either to take up or to sell their rights.\nRelief for such a reduction in value is provided by subsection (3) of ITEPA03/S480. So, if there is a single class of shares and a one-for-one rights issue at a discount, each existing share will reduce in value.",
