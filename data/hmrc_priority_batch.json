    "content": "The concept of tax advantaged share schemes originated in FA 1978 with the introduction of approved profit sharing schemes (APSS, since abolished). In FA 1980 the Savings Related Share Option Scheme was introduced. Sometimes known as Sharesave (or SAYE), it is an all-employee share option scheme that links regular savings with share options. Discretionary share option schemes were introduced by FA 1984. They are now referred to in the legislation as CSOP schemes (previously known as company share option plans or executive share option schemes) and, as the previous name implies, employees are selected to participate rather than the company being obliged to invite all employees to take part.",

The former replaced the APSS with the flexibility to provide different types of share award and, like SAYE, it is an all-employee scheme. EMI, unlike the other schemes does not have an approval process, and is intended to help small higher risk companies to recruit and retain skilled employees.",
